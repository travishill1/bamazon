  "description": "<p>\r Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL.\r <br>\r This repo has three different applications which all use a single database:\r <br>\r <strong>bamazonCustomer</strong>- Takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.  <br>\r Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale.  The app then prompts users with two messages.\r <br>\r The first asks them the ID of the product they would like to buy.\r <br>\r The second asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.\r <br>\r <br>\r <strong>bamazonManager</strong>- Running this application will allow the user to pick between four options: <br>\r 1) View Products for Sale - logs in the console all the products currently up for sale. <br>\r 2) View Low Inventory - logs in the console all the products that have less than 5 units left. <br>\r 3) Add to Inventory - allows the user to add units to an existing product stock. <br>\r 4) Add New Product - allows the user to create a new product in the database. <br>\r <br>",
